This front end uses generated types for its API.  they are generated with openapi-typescript and live in src/lib/management.d.ts

THEY MUST NOT BE MODIFIED MANUALLY.

To query against this API with these types, us the openapi-fetch library ONLY:

An example call:

```typescript
import createClient from "openapi-fetch";
import type { paths } from "./my-openapi-3-schema"; // generated by openapi-typescript

const client = createClient<paths>({ baseUrl: "https://myapi.dev/v1/" });

const { data, error } = await client.GET("/blogposts/{post_id}", {
  params: {
    path: { post_id: "my-post" },
    query: { version: 2 },
  },
});

const { data, error } = await client.PUT("/blogposts", {
  body: {
    title: "New Post",
    body: "<p>New post body</p>",
    publish_date: new Date("2023-03-01T12:00:00Z").getTime(),
  },
});
```
